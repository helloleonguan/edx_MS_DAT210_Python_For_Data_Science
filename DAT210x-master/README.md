## Getting Started

 * Download and install the [Anaconda 4.2.0 Graphical Installer](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for your operating system (Linux, OS/X, or Windows).
 * Be sure to select the installer for Python version 2.7.
 * Execute the following pip commands on your terminal / command line:

 ```
   sudo pip install BeautifulSoup4
   sudo pip install html5lib==1.0b8
   sudo pip install plyfile
 ```

 If you are on Windows (instead of Linux / Mac), you will not be able to run the `sudo` command. Try running these instead:

 ```
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python -m pip install BeautifulSoup4
   python -m pip install html5lib==1.0b8
   python -m pip install plyfile
 ```
 
Your anaconda installer comes pre-loaded with the following packages:

 * matplotlib
 * numpy
 * scipy
 * pandas
 * scikit-learn
 * spyder
